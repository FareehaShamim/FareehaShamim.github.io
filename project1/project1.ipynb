    "# Project 1: How Public Wi-Fi Is Distributed Across New York City\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this topic**  \n",
    "Public Wi-Fi sounds mundane, but it is part of digital inclusion. When home internet is unaffordable or unstable, free hotspots at libraries, parks, and sidewalks help with school, job applications, telehealth, and city services. I wanted a first-pass view of **where** these hotspots are concentrated across the five boroughs. Not a fancy map. Just a clear, reproducible profile that anyone can run.\n",
    "\n",
    "**My goal**  \n",
    "My goal with this Project was to build a short, readable snapshot of NYC’s public Wi-Fi so that anyone can see which boroughs have more hotspots at a glance, using basic summary stats and a tiny text chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did that by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loading the NYC Public Wi-Fi Locations dataset and using the `Latitude` column as my numeric example, then calculating the mean, median, and mode with pandas to make sure the data loaded cleanly and sits where NYC should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Repeating those same three numbers (mean, median, mode) using only the Python standard library to show I can get the same result even without any data libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Counting how many Wi-Fi hotspots are in each borough and printing a simple text chart made of `+` signs (with a legend like “1 `+` = 50 hotspots”) so you can quickly see which boroughs have more coverage.\n"
